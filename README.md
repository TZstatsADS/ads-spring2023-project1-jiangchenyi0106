1. Find reading-friendly philosophers who use less uncommon words based on a self-defined metric 𝑈𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑑𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦.
2. Utilized TF-IDF to generate a word cloud for Smith(a reading-friendly philosopher chosen) to quickly grasp the main topics he emphasizes on.
3. Explore how capitalism developed in the era based on semantic analysis with NRC Emotion lexicon
